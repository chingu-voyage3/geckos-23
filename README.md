3- At the top left there is a create quiz button and beside it is the user's avatar.

4- When the user press the creat quiz button he is transfered to the quiz creator page. 

5- When the user presses the avatar there is a dropdown menu which contain his profile and sign out and his quizzes.

6- About the quiz creator page here comes the heavy stuff there will be many types of quizzes the user chose the type he wants with in select element .
